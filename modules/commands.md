# About the module

This module will allow you to modify the behavior of Filo's commands.

## Disable commands or categories

In the selection menu, you need to click on the **Disable commands** or **Disable categories** action.

Next, a selection menu will be displayed, limited to 25 items with some pagination controls *(just like a book)*.

Select as many items as you want to disable, and if you can't find the item you want to disable, simply go back or forward.

> By disabling a command or category, it cannot be used by any user of the server (not even the owner of the server).
> {.is-danger}

## Enable commands or categories

This procedure is exactly identical to the previous one. You just have to select in the action to carry out **Enable commands** or **Enable categories** and select the items you want to enable.
